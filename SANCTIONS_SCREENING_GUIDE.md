# VirdisPay Sanctions Screening System

## Overview
Automated sanctions screening using **FREE government APIs** to check merchants against global watchlists.

## What Gets Checked

### Automatically Screened Against:

‚úÖ **UN Sanctions List** (United Nations Security Council)
‚úÖ **High-Risk Countries** (Iran, North Korea, Syria, Cuba, Russia, etc.)

### How It Works:

**1. When Merchant Submits KYC:**
   - System automatically downloads latest OFAC sanctions list (updates every 24 hours)
   - Checks merchant's business name against the list
   - Checks individual name (first + last name) against the list
   - Uses fuzzy matching algorithm (85% similarity threshold)
   - Checks if country is sanctioned or high-risk

**2. If Match Found:**
   - üö® KYC status set to "FLAGGED"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk level elevated to "HIGH"
   - üìß Admin notified immediately
   - üõë Merchant cannot process payments until manual review
   - Red warning shown in admin KYC review dashboard

**3. Screening Results Shown:**
   - Match type (Business Name / Individual Name / Country)
   - Confidence percentage
   - Matched sanctions list entry
   - Risk score calculation
