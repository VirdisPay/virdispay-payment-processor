# Fly.io Credit Card & Pricing Info

## ‚úÖ Is It Safe?

**YES** - Fly.io is a legitimate, well-established company used by thousands of developers.

## üí≥ Why Do They Ask for Credit Card?

Fly.io requires a credit card for:
- **Account verification** (prevents abuse)
- **Free tier access** (they give you free credits)
- **Billing if you exceed free tier**

## üí∞ What Are You Charged?

### Free Tier Includes:
- **3 shared-cpu-1x VMs (256MB RAM)**
- **3GB persistent volume storage**
- **160GB outbound data transfer**
- **Typically enough for small-medium apps**

### You Get Charged Only If You:
- Exceed free tier limits
- Use premium VMs
- Use more storage/data than included

**For your VirdisPay app:** You'll likely stay within free tier if you're just starting!

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Tips:

1. **Set up usage alerts** (they'll email if approaching limits)
2. **Monitor your dashboard** regularly
3. **They charge per hour** - easy to turn off if needed
4. **Can delete account anytime**

## üí° Alternatives (If You Don't Want to Add Card):

### Option 1: **Railway** (Free tier, no card needed initially)
- But requires GitHub OAuth (your issue)
- If GitHub unflags, this becomes easiest

### Option 2: **Render.com** (Free tier)
- Also requires GitHub (your issue)
- No card for free tier

### Option 3: **DigitalOcean Droplet** ($5/month)
- Pay upfront, no card verification needed
- You control everything
- Can use GitHub via SSH (no OAuth!)

### Option 4: **Wait 24-48 hours**
- For GitHub to unflag your account
- Then use Railway/Render for free (no card needed)
