# üîê Password Reset Feature - Implementation Complete

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

Your VirdisPay platform now has a complete **password recovery system** with email-based password reset functionality.

---

## üéØ **How It Works:**

### **1. User Requests Password Reset**
1. User clicks **"Forgot your password?"** link on login page
2. Enters their email address
3. System generates a secure reset token (hashed with SHA-256)
4. Token is saved to database with 1-hour expiration
5. Email sent with reset link

### **2. User Receives Email**
- Professional HTML email template
- Contains reset button and plain text link
- Link expires in 1 hour
- Works even if email service fails (token still saved)

### **3. User Resets Password**
1. Clicks link in email (opens reset password page)
2. Enters new password (must be 8+ characters)
3. Confirms new password
4. System validates token and expiration
5. Password is updated and token is cleared
6. Confirmation email sent

### **4. User Can Log In**
- Old password no longer works
- Can immediately log in with new password
- Auto-redirected to login page

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Features:**

### **‚úÖ Secure Token Generation**
- **Crypto-random tokens** (32 bytes / 64 hex characters)
- **SHA-256 hashing** before database storage
- **1-hour expiration** (short window to prevent abuse)
- **One-time use** (token deleted after successful reset)

### **‚úÖ Information Disclosure Protection**
- Always returns success message even if email doesn't exist
- Prevents attackers from discovering valid email addresses
- Security best practice for password reset flows

### **‚úÖ Rate Limiting**
- Uses existing `passwordResetRateLimit` middleware
- Prevents brute force attacks
- Protects against spam/abuse

### **‚úÖ Non-Blocking Email**
- Reset works even if email service fails
- Email errors logged but don't break functionality
- Token still saved to database

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**

### **Email Configuration Required for Production:**
The password reset feature sends emails. For production:
1. Configure Gmail App Password in `.env`:
   ```
   GMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   ```
2. Or use another email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
3. Email failures won't break password reset (non-blocking)

### **Token Expiration:**
- Tokens expire after **1 hour** by default
- Change in `server/routes/auth.js` line 718:
  ```javascript
  user.resetPasswordExpires = Date.now() + 3600000; // 1 hour in ms
  ```

### **Password Requirements:**
- Minimum 8 characters (enforced backend + frontend)
- Change in `server/routes/auth.js` validation:
  ```javascript
  body('password').isLength({ min: 8 })
  ```
