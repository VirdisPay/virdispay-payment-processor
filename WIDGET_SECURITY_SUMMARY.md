# 🔒 VirdisPay Widget Security - FIXED

## ✅ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE RESOLVED

### Problem You Identified:
> "is it ok that we have got the code for our pay now button on our website? could people start using this without setting up an account"

**Answer: YES, this was a CRITICAL security vulnerability - NOW FIXED!**

---

## 🚨 What Was Wrong (Before)

Anyone could:
- ❌ Copy your widget code from your website
- ❌ Use someone else's `merchantId` to steal their payments
- ❌ Embed your widget on any website without permission
- ❌ Hijack payments meant for legitimate merchants
- ❌ No way to verify who was using the widget

**Example Attack:**
```html
<!-- Attacker copies widget code and changes merchantId -->
<div data-virdispay-widget="button"
     data-merchant-id="SOMEONE_ELSES_ID"
     data-amount="100">
</div>
<!-- Payments would go to the wrong merchant! -->
```

---

## ✅ What's Fixed (Now)

### TWO-LAYER SECURITY (Maximum Protection):

#### 1. API KEY AUTHENTICATION
- Every merchant gets **unique API keys**
- Public Key (`pk_live_xxx`) - used in widget (safe to expose)
- Secret Key (`sk_live_xxx`) - server-side only (NEVER expose)
- Widget **REQUIRES** API key to work
- Invalid API key = Payment **REJECTED**

#### 2. DOMAIN WHITELISTING
- Merchants register their **approved websites**
- Server checks payment comes from **whitelisted domain**
- Unauthorized domain = Payment **BLOCKED**
- Multiple domains supported per merchant

---

## 🔐 How It Works Now

### For Merchants:

**Step 1: Generate API Keys**
```
Dashboard → API Keys → Generate Keys
- Get: pk_live_abcd1234... (public key)
- Get: sk_live_xyz9876... (secret key) ⚠️ Save this! Only shown once!
```

**Step 2: Whitelist Domains**
```
Dashboard → API Keys → Add Domain
- Add: myshop.com
- Add: checkout.myshop.com
- Add: shop.mycompany.com
```

**Step 3: Update Widget Code**
```html
<script src="https://widgets.virdispay.com/virdispay-widget.js"></script>

<div data-virdispay-widget="button"
     data-api-key="pk_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
     data-amount="100"
     data-currency="USD">
</div>

<script>
  VirdisPay.init({
    apiKey: 'pk_live_YOUR_KEY_HERE',
    onSuccess: function(payment) {
      console.log('Payment successful!', payment);
    }
  });
</script>
```

### For Attackers (What They CAN'T Do Anymore):

❌ **Can't copy your merchantId** - It's not used anymore, API key is required  
❌ **Can't use your API key on their site** - Domain not whitelisted  
❌ **Can't steal payments** - Both API key AND domain must match  
❌ **Can't bypass validation** - Server checks both layers

## 🎯 Example Scenarios

### ✅ ALLOWED: Legitimate Merchant

```
Merchant: "Coffee Shop"
API Key: pk_live_abc123...
Domain: coffeeshop.com

Widget on coffeeshop.com:
<div data-api-key="pk_live_abc123..." ...>

Server checks:
✓ API key valid (belongs to Coffee Shop)
✓ Domain valid (coffeeshop.com is whitelisted)
✓ Payment APPROVED
```

### ❌ BLOCKED: Stolen API Key

```
Attacker copies Coffee Shop's widget code
Puts it on evil-site.com

Server checks:
✓ API key valid (belongs to Coffee Shop)
✗ Domain invalid (evil-site.com NOT whitelisted)
✗ Payment REJECTED: "Domain not whitelisted"
```

### ❌ BLOCKED: Fake API Key

```
Attacker creates fake API key
Puts widget on their site

Server checks:
✗ API key invalid (doesn't exist in database)
✗ Payment REJECTED: "Invalid API key"
```

### ❌ BLOCKED: No API Key

```
Someone copies old widget code without API key

Server checks:
✗ API key missing (required parameter)
✗ Payment REJECTED: "API key required"
```

## 📞 Questions?

**Q: Can someone copy my public API key?**  
A: Yes, but it won't work on their site - domain must match whitelist.

**Q: What if my API key leaks?**  
A: Regenerate it immediately in dashboard. Update your widget with new key.

**Q: Do I need to add every subdomain?**  
A: No! Whitelisting `example.com` automatically allows `shop.example.com`, `checkout.example.com`, etc.

**Q: Can I test locally?**  
A: Yes! `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` are automatically whitelisted for all merchants.

**Q: What happens to old widget code?**  
A: It will be rejected. All widgets must use API keys now.

**Q: Can I have multiple websites?**  
A: Yes! Add as many domains as you need in the whitelist.
