# Cannabis Businesses Save 75% on Payment Processing with VirdisPay's 2.5% vs Traditional 10-15% Fees

**London, UK - October 18, 2024** - VirdisPay, the non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor, today revealed that cannabis businesses can save up to 75% on payment processing fees compared to traditional high-risk processors. While traditional processors charge 10-15% for cannabis businesses, VirdisPay offers just 2.5% transaction fees with zero banking restrictions.

## The Hidden Cost of Payment Processing Discrimination

Cannabis businesses face a unique financial burden: traditional payment processors either reject them entirely or charge exorbitant fees of 10-15% per transaction. This is 3-6 times higher than standard 2.9% credit card processing fees, creating a massive competitive disadvantage for legal businesses.

"Most people don't realize that cannabis dispensaries are paying 10-15% in processing fees," said the VirdisPay team. "A $100 purchase costs the business $10-15 just in payment processing. That's unsustainable for any business model."

## 75% Fee Reduction with Crypto Payments

VirdisPay's cryptocurrency payment solution offers cannabis businesses a dramatic fee reduction:

**Traditional High-Risk Processors:**
- Cannabis businesses: 10-15% transaction fees
- Account freezes and terminations common
- Long approval processes (6-12 months)
- High monthly minimums ($500-2000)

**VirdisPay Crypto Payments:**
- Cannabis businesses: 2.5% transaction fees (free tier)
- No banking restrictions or account freezes
- Instant approval and setup
- No monthly minimums

## Real-World Savings Examples

**Example 1: Small Dispensary ($50,000 monthly sales)**
- Traditional processor: $5,000-7,500 in fees (10-15%)
- VirdisPay: $1,250 in fees (2.5%)
- **Monthly savings: $3,750-6,250**
- **Annual savings: $45,000-75,000**

**Example 2: Medium Dispensary ($200,000 monthly sales)**
- Traditional processor: $20,000-30,000 in fees
- VirdisPay: $5,000 in fees
- **Monthly savings: $15,000-25,000**
- **Annual savings: $180,000-300,000**

## Why Traditional Processors Charge So Much

High-risk processors justify their 10-15% fees by citing:
- **Regulatory compliance costs** (AML/KYC requirements)
- **Chargeback risk** (higher for cannabis businesses)
- **Banking relationship costs** (limited bank options)
- **Regulatory uncertainty** (federal vs state law conflicts)

VirdisPay eliminates these costs through:
- **Non-custodial architecture** (no fund custody)
- **Smart contract escrow** (eliminates chargebacks)
- **Cryptocurrency payments** (no banking restrictions)
- **Built-in compliance** (automated AML/KYC)
