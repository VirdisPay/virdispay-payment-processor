HEADLINE: VirdisPay Launches Crypto Payment Platform for Regulated Merchants

[London, UK - DATE] - VirdisPay, a London-based financial technology company, today announced the launch of its cryptocurrency payment processing platform designed for regulated and specialty merchants who face ongoing banking friction. The platform enables compliant businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments with significantly lower fees, while maintaining full Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) safeguards.

Merchants operating in tightly regulated verticals often encounter persistent obstacles when seeking reliable payment processing:
• Traditional payment processors frequently decline applications from compliance-heavy merchants even when they operate legally
• High-risk providers charge 10-15% transaction fees compared to standard retail rates of 2.9%
• Accounts can be frozen without warning, disrupting cashflow and customer experience
• Lengthy underwriting processes and high monthly minimums place smaller operators at a disadvantage

VirdisPay's cryptocurrency payment platform removes these bottlenecks by delivering a secure, compliant alternative to legacy payment rails:
• No traditional banking relationship required—runs entirely on audited blockchain infrastructure
• Transaction fees start at 2.5% on the free tier, significantly lower than traditional high-risk pricing
• Instant onboarding and approval, eliminating months-long waiting periods
• Built-in KYC/AML automation, sanctions screening, and risk scoring

“Our platform was built to support merchants who are fully compliant but still encounter barriers from traditional processors,” said [Your Name], Founder and CEO of VirdisPay. “We combine the trust of a regulated payments program with the efficiency of blockchain technology so merchants can accept digital assets without compromising security, compliance or customer experience.”

Compliance-Driven Architecture
• Automated Know Your Customer (KYC) workflows with configurable risk rules
• Real-time Anti-Money Laundering (AML) monitoring and suspicious activity alerts
• Document management for licenses, certificates, and audit requirements
• Non-custodial architecture that keeps merchants in direct control of settlement wallets

Smart Routing Across Global Networks
VirdisPay automatically routes each transaction to the most cost-effective blockchain network, supporting stablecoin payments across Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and other leading ecosystems. Merchants gain predictable settlement times and transparent fee structures without managing multiple crypto integrations.

Industry Impact
Regulated merchants in nutraceuticals, specialty retail, high-compliance export, and other niche sectors routinely pay triple the processing costs of mainstream e-commerce. By lowering processing fees to 2.5% (free tier) and eliminating unexpected account freezes, VirdisPay helps these businesses preserve margins, scale internationally, and deliver a stable customer checkout experience.

Platform Availability
The VirdisPay crypto payment platform is available immediately in jurisdictions where digital asset payments are permitted. Pricing tiers range from a no-cost starter plan to enterprise options with dedicated compliance support, multi-user access, and enhanced analytics.
