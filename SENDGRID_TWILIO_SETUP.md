# SendGrid via Twilio Setup Guide

## ✅ This is Normal!

SendGrid is owned by Twilio, so signup redirects to Twilio. The service is still SendGrid!

## Step 1: Sign Up via Twilio

1. You should be on a Twilio signup page
2. Fill in:
   - Email address
   - Password
   - Your details
3. Complete verification (check email)
4. You'll be taken to Twilio Console

## Step 2: Navigate to SendGrid

1. In Twilio Console, look for **"SendGrid"** in the left menu
2. OR go to: **https://app.sendgrid.com/**
3. OR search for "SendGrid" in Twilio dashboard

---

## Step 3: Access SendGrid Email API

1. Once in SendGrid (within Twilio):
2. Look for **"Settings"** or **"API Keys"**
3. Or go to: **https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys**

## Alternative: Direct SendGrid Access

If Twilio is confusing, you can also:

1. Go directly to: **https://signup.sendgrid.com/email-api**
2. Or try: **https://app.sendgrid.com/** (might redirect you to login via Twilio)
3. Login with Twilio credentials if needed

## Step 4: Create API Key (Same as Before)

1. In SendGrid → **Settings** → **API Keys**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**

4. Permissions: **"Full Access"**
5. **Copy the API key!**

## If You're Stuck in Twilio Console:

1. Look for **"SendGrid Email API"** in the Twilio products list
2. Click it to access SendGrid dashboard
3. From there, follow normal SendGrid setup
