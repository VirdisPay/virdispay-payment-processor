# ✅ Subscription Selection Visual Fix

## 🎯 **Problem Fixed:**
The green selection box was not visible when selecting subscription tiers.

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### **1. Enhanced Selection Indicator**
- **Stronger border**: Blue border instead of subtle green
- **Thicker shadow**: 4px border with 30% opacity
- **Higher z-index**: Ensures it appears above other elements
- **Lifted position**: Card moves up when selected

### **2. Added Checkmark Badge**
- **Visible checkmark**: ✓ appears in top-right corner
- **Blue gradient background**: Matches the selection theme
- **High z-index**: Always visible above other elements
- **Shadow effect**: Makes it stand out

### **3. Improved Button Feedback**
- **Pulsing animation**: Continue button pulses when selection is made
- **Color change**: Button becomes active when tier is selected
- **Visual feedback**: Clear indication that selection is working

## 🎨 **Visual Changes:**

### **Before (Problem):**
- ❌ Subtle green border barely visible
- ❌ Selection indicator covered by other elements
- ❌ No clear visual feedback

### **After (Fixed):**
- ✅ **Bold blue border** with shadow
- ✅ **Checkmark badge** in corner
- ✅ **Pulsing continue button**
- ✅ **Card lifts up** when selected
- ✅ **Clear visual hierarchy**

4. **Test subscription selection:**
