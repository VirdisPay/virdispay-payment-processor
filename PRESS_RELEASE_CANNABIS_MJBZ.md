# VirdisPay Solves Banking Discrimination for Legal Cannabis Businesses with 2.5% Crypto Payment Processing

**London, UK - October 18, 2024** - VirdisPay, a non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor, today announced a solution to banking discrimination faced by legal cannabis businesses. The platform offers 2.5% transaction fees compared to traditional high-risk processors that charge 10-15%, providing immediate financial access to businesses systematically excluded from traditional banking.

## The Cannabis Banking Crisis

Legal cannabis businesses face systematic banking discrimination despite operating legally in their states. Traditional payment processors either reject them entirely or charge exorbitant fees of 10-15% per transaction, creating an unsustainable financial burden for businesses in a $30 billion industry.

"Cannabis businesses are paying 10-15% in processing fees simply because traditional finance discriminates against them," said the VirdisPay team. "A $100 purchase costs the business $10-15 just in payment processing. That's not sustainable for any business model."

## Banking Discrimination Solution

VirdisPay's non-custodial cryptocurrency payment solution eliminates banking discrimination:

**Traditional Banking Discrimination:**
- Cannabis businesses: 10-15% transaction fees
- Account freezes and terminations common
- Long approval processes (6-12 months)
- High monthly minimums ($500-2000)
- Banking relationship restrictions

**VirdisPay Crypto Payments:**
- Cannabis businesses: 2.5% transaction fees (free tier)
- No banking restrictions or account freezes

## Why Traditional Processors Discriminate

High-risk processors justify their 10-15% fees by citing regulatory compliance costs, chargeback risk, limited banking relationships, and regulatory uncertainty. VirdisPay eliminates these costs through:

- **Non-custodial architecture** (no fund custody)
- **Smart contract escrow** (eliminates chargebacks)
- **Cryptocurrency payments** (no banking restrictions)
- **Built-in compliance** (automated AML/KYC)
