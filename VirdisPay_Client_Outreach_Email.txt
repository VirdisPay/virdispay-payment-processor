Subject: Stop Paying 10-15% in Payment Processing Fees

Hi [Client Name],

Are you tired of watching 10-15% of every transaction disappear into payment processing fees? 

While other businesses pay just 2.9%, you're paying 3-5 times more simply because traditional processors treat your industry as "high-risk." That's thousands—or even tens of thousands—dollars every month that could be going back into your business.

**What if there was a better way?**

I'm reaching out because VirdisPay was built specifically for businesses like yours that are being overcharged by traditional payment processors. We offer cryptocurrency payment processing starting at just 2.5%—that's **75-83% lower** than what you're likely paying now.

**Here's what makes VirdisPay different:**

💰 **Dramatically Lower Fees**
- Traditional high-risk processors: 10-15% per transaction

Subject: A Better Way to Accept Payments for Your Business

Hi [Client Name],

I noticed your business is in [their industry], and I know how challenging payment processing can be for companies in your sector.

While most businesses pay 2.9% for payment processing, many companies in regulated industries are paying 10-15% per transaction simply because traditional processors consider them "high-risk." That means on every $100 sale, you're losing $10-15 just in payment processing fees.

There's a better way.

VirdisPay is a cryptocurrency payment processor specifically designed for businesses that are being overcharged by traditional payment companies. We help businesses like yours reduce payment processing fees from 10-15% down to just 2.5% (free tier)—saving thousands of dollars every month.

Would you be interested in a quick conversation about how we can help reduce your payment processing costs?
