# Deploy to Railway via Web Dashboard (No CLI Login Needed)

Since CLI login is having issues, let's use Railway's web interface with Git push!

## Step 1: Sign Up/Login to Railway (Web)
1. Go to: **https://railway.app**
2. Click **"Start a New Project"** or **"Login"**
3. Sign up/login with **EMAIL** (not GitHub)
4. Complete account setup

## Step 2: Create New Project
1. In Railway dashboard → Click **"New Project"**
2. Click **"Empty Project"** (we'll add code manually)

## Step 3: Get Railway Git Remote URL
1. In your Railway project → Go to **Settings** tab
2. Scroll to **"Git"** section
3. Copy the **Git URL** (looks like: `https://railway.app/git/xxxxx/xxxxx`)

## Step 4: Add Railway as Git Remote
Open PowerShell in your project folder and run:
```powershell
git remote add railway <paste-the-railway-git-url-here>
```

For example:
```powershell
git remote add railway https://railway.app/git/xxxxx/xxxxx
```

## Step 5: Push to Railway
```powershell
git push railway master
```

Railway will automatically:
- Detect your code
- Build your app (runs `npm run build`)
- Deploy it!

## Step 6: Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard → Your Service → **Variables** tab:
- Add all your environment variables (see RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Step 7: Add MongoDB
In Railway dashboard → **New** → **Database** → **Add MongoDB**

**This method bypasses CLI login completely!** ✅
