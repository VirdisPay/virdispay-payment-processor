# 🔔 DYNAMIC FEES REMINDER

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: Don't Forget This!**

After the mainnet deployment is complete and the system is live, we need to implement dynamic fees for subscription tiers.

---

## 📋 **Current Status:**

✅ **Smart contract deployed** with 2.5% default fee  
✅ **Backend service ready** (`dynamicFeeService.js`)  
❌ **Dynamic fees not yet implemented** in smart contract  

---

## 🎯 **What Needs to Be Done:**

### **Phase 1: After Mainnet Deployment**
1. **Test the live system** with 2.5% default fee
2. **Verify fee collection** is working
3. **Get some real transactions** flowing

### **Phase 2: Add Dynamic Fees (PRIORITY)**
1. **Modify smart contract** to support per-merchant fees
2. **Update backend** to call contract when merchants subscribe
3. **Test dynamic fee changes** on testnet first
4. **Deploy updated contract** to mainnet

---

## 💰 **Fee Structure to Implement:**

| Subscription | Monthly Cost | Transaction Fee |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Free** | $0 | 2.5% |
| **Starter** | $29 | 1.5% |
| **Professional** | $99 | 1.0% |
| **Enterprise** | $299 | 0.5% |

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation:**

### **Smart Contract Changes Needed:**
- Add `mapping(address => uint256) merchantFees`
- Add `setMerchantFee(address merchant, uint256 fee)` function
- Modify payment processing to use merchant-specific fees

### **Backend Changes Needed:**
- Update `dynamicFeeService.js` to call new contract function
- Add subscription change detection
- Add fee update triggers

---

## ⏰ **Timeline:**

1. **Now:** Deploy with 2.5% default (system goes live)
2. **Week 1:** Test and verify everything works
3. **Week 2:** Implement dynamic fees
4. **Week 3:** Deploy updated contract

---

## 🚨 **REMINDER TRIGGERS:**

- When you see merchants signing up for paid plans
- When you want to offer competitive pricing
- When you need to differentiate from free tier
- When you want to maximize revenue from premium customers

---

## 📞 **How to Remember:**

1. **Bookmark this file** in your project
2. **Set a calendar reminder** for 1 week after mainnet deployment
3. **Add to your project roadmap** as a priority feature
4. **Tell me when you're ready** to implement this

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria:**

- Merchants can subscribe to different tiers
- Transaction fees automatically adjust based on subscription
- Revenue increases from premium subscriptions
- System remains stable and secure
