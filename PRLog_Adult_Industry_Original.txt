Adult Content Industry Gets 75% Payment Processing Fee Reduction with VirdisPay's Cryptocurrency Solution

October 18, 2024 - VirdisPay, a revolutionary non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor, today announced a breakthrough solution for the adult content industry's payment processing challenges. The platform offers adult content platforms a dramatic 75% reduction in processing fees, charging just 2.5% compared to traditional high-risk processors that charge 10-15%.

BREAKING THE PAYMENT PROCESSING BARRIER

The adult content industry has long been systematically excluded from traditional payment processing services. Most platforms face either complete rejection or exorbitant fees of 10-15% per transaction, creating an unsustainable financial burden for legal businesses in a $100+ billion global industry.

"Adult content platforms are paying 3-6 times more in processing fees than standard businesses," explained the VirdisPay team. "A simple $100 transaction costs the business $10-15 just in payment processing. This is economically unsustainable and discriminates against legal businesses."

REVOLUTIONARY CRYPTOCURRENCY PAYMENT SOLUTION

VirdisPay's innovative approach eliminates traditional payment processing barriers through:

Traditional Payment Processors:
- Adult content platforms: 10-15% transaction fees
- Frequent account terminations and freezes
- Lengthy approval processes (6-12 months)
- High monthly minimums ($500-2000)
- Banking relationship restrictions

VirdisPay Cryptocurrency Payments:
- Adult content platforms: 2.5% transaction fees (free tier)
- Zero banking restrictions or account freezes
- Instant approval and immediate setup
- No monthly minimums or hidden fees
- Direct wallet-to-wallet transfers

MASSIVE COST SAVINGS FOR ADULT CONTENT PLATFORMS

The financial impact is substantial for adult content platforms:

Small Adult Platform ($50,000 monthly revenue):
- Traditional processor: $5,000-7,500 in fees (10-15%)
- VirdisPay: $1,250 in fees (2.5%)

- Annual savings: $45,000-75,000

- Traditional processor: $20,000-30,000 in fees
- VirdisPay: $5,000 in fees

- Annual savings: $180,000-300,000
