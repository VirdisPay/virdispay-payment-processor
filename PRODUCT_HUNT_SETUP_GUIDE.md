### **When someone asks "What are the fees?"**

```
Great question! Here's our pricing:

• Platform fee: 0.02% per transaction
• Network gas fees: ~$0.01-0.05 (depends on network)
• No monthly fees
• No setup fees
• No hidden costs

Compare that to traditional processors:
• Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
• PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
• Square: 2.6% + $0.10 per transaction

For a $100 transaction:
• Traditional: $2.90 - $3.20
• VirdisPay: $0.02 - $0.07

That's 99.98% savings!

We do offer premium plans with additional features, but the core payment processing is just 0.02%.

Hope that helps!
```

### **When someone asks "Is this legal?"**

```
Yes, VirdisPay operates in jurisdictions where cryptocurrency payments are legal.

We work with:
• Licensed cannabis businesses (in legal states)
• CBD companies (federally legal in US)
• Vape shops
• Other high-risk merchants

We include built-in KYC/AML compliance to ensure:
• All merchants are verified
• All transactions are legitimate
• Regulatory compliance is maintained

We don't work with illegal businesses, and we verify all merchants before they can accept payments.

Thanks for asking!
```

### **When someone asks "How is this different from [competitor]?"**

```
Great question! Here's how VirdisPay is different:

1. **Focus:** Built specifically for high-risk industries that traditional processors reject

2. **Fees:** 0.02% vs competitors' 2-3% (99.98% savings)

3. **Non-Custodial:** You keep your private keys - we never hold your funds

4. **Smart Routing:** Automatically finds cheapest network (Polygon, BSC, Arbitrum)

5. **Compliance:** Built-in KYC/AML - no separate compliance setup needed

6. **No Banking:** Works entirely on blockchain - no bank account needed

Unlike [competitor], we're not trying to compete with traditional processors. We're built for businesses that traditional processors won't touch.

Does that help clarify?
```

### **When someone says "I'd love to try this!"**
