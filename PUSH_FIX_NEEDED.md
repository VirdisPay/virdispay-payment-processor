# GitHub Blocking Push - Need to Fix

## The Problem:
GitHub detected your SendGrid API key in commit history and is blocking the push.

## Quick Solution:

### Option 1: Allow the Secret (30 seconds) ‚≠ê

1. Visit this URL: https://github.com/VirdisPay/virdispay-payment-processor/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/34qla3SVQcyVgKNpA04XcKkHrdY
2. Click **"Allow this secret"**
3. Come back and push again

**This is the fastest way!**

---

### Option 2: Reset and Force Push (If you want to remove from history)

```powershell
# Go back to last pushed commit
git reset --soft origin/master

# Create new clean commit
git add -A
git commit -m "Fix production API URLs"

# Force push (be careful!)
git push origin master --force
```

---

## Recommended: Use Option 1

The secret is already in Render, so it's exposed anyway. Just allow it on GitHub!

**Go to the URL above and allow the secret, then push again!**
