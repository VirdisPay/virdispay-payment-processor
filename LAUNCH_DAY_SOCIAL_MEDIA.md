Hey r/startups!

I just launched VirdisPay on Product Hunt today. It's a cryptocurrency payment processor built specifically for high-risk industries that struggle with traditional payment processors.

**The Problem:**
Cannabis, CBD, vaping, and other high-risk businesses either:
- Can't get payment processors
- Pay 3%+ fees
- Get accounts shut down unexpectedly

**The Solution:**
VirdisPay charges 0.02% fees (99.98% savings), works with industries banks reject, and is completely non-custodial.

**What I'd love:**
- Your feedback on Product Hunt
- Questions about the product
- Suggestions for improvement
