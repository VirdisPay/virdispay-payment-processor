# VirdisPay Launches Revolutionary Crypto Payment Processor for Cannabis, Vaping, and High-Risk Industries - Cuts Transaction Fees by 99%

**London, UK - October 18, 2024** - VirdisPay, a new non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor, today announced its official launch, offering businesses in cannabis, vaping, nutraceuticals, and other high-risk industries an alternative to traditional payment processors that routinely reject them.

## Breaking Banking Barriers for High-Risk Industries

Traditional payment processors and banks systematically deny services to legal [cannabis dispensaries](https://virdispay.com/cannabis.html), [vape shops](https://virdispay.com/vaping.html), supplement companies, and other high-risk businesses - even in jurisdictions where these businesses operate legally. VirdisPay solves this problem by enabling businesses to [accept stablecoin payments](https://virdispay.com) (USDC, USDT, DAI) with dramatically lower fees and zero banking restrictions.

"We've built VirdisPay specifically for businesses that traditional finance rejects," said the VirdisPay team. "Cannabis dispensaries paying 5-8% in processing fees, vape shops getting their accounts frozen, supplement businesses facing FDA-related banking discrimination - these are solvable problems with cryptocurrency."

## 99.98% Lower Transaction Costs with Smart Routing Technology

VirdisPay's proprietary Smart Payment Routing technology automatically selects the most cost-effective blockchain network for each transaction, reducing gas fees from $20-$200 (Ethereum) to just $0.01 (Polygon). Combined with a 1% platform fee for paid subscribers, merchants save dramatically compared to traditional 3-8% credit card processing fees.

**Key Features:**

- **Stablecoin Payments:** Accept USDC, USDT, and DAI - cryptocurrencies that maintain a stable $1.00 value, eliminating volatility concerns
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Automatic routing across Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and Optimism
- **Non-Custodial Security:** Direct wallet-to-wallet transfers with zero custody risk
- **Instant Settlement:** Payments confirmed in 2-3 seconds vs. 3-5 days with traditional processors
- **Zero Chargebacks:** Cryptocurrency transactions are final, eliminating fraud
- **UK & US Coverage:** Licensed cannabis businesses in all 50 US states, plus UK CBD and hemp businesses

## Serving Seven High-Risk Industries

VirdisPay currently supports businesses in:
- **Cannabis & Hemp** - Licensed dispensaries, CBD products, hemp cultivation
- **Vaping & E-Liquids** - Vape shops, e-cigarette retailers
- **Nutraceuticals** - Dietary supplements, wellness products
- **Adult Content** - Platforms and content creators
- **Gaming & Gambling** - Online casinos, sports betting platforms

- **Starter ($29/month):** 1% transaction fee, up to $100,000 monthly volume
- **Professional ($99/month):** 1% transaction fee, up to $100,000 monthly volume

The platform performs automatic sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, and risk assessment.

"Compliance is built into our DNA," the team stated. "We're not helping businesses bypass regulations - we're helping legal businesses access financial services they deserve."

## Availability and Integration

VirdisPay is available immediately. The platform offers [cryptocurrency payment integration](https://virdispay.com) through website widgets, REST API, and e-commerce plugins for WooCommerce and Shopify.
