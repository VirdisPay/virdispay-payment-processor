Crypto Payment Processor VirdisPay Cuts High-Risk Industry Fees by 75% vs Traditional Processors

VirdisPay's non-custodial cryptocurrency payment platform offers high-risk businesses 2.5% transaction fees vs traditional 10-15%, eliminating banking restrictions and providing instant financial access.

High-risk industries including cannabis, vaping, nutraceuticals, adult content, and gaming have long faced systematic exclusion from traditional payment processing services. These legal businesses are either rejected entirely or charged exorbitant fees of 10-15% per transaction, creating an unsustainable financial burden in multi-billion dollar industries.

"High-risk businesses are paying 3-6 times more in processing fees than standard businesses," explained the VirdisPay team. "A $100 transaction costs the business $10-15 just in payment processing. This discrimination against legal businesses is economically unsustainable."
