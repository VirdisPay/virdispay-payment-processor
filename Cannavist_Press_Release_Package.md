# Cannabis Dispensaries Save 75% on Payment Processing with VirdisPay's 2.5% vs Traditional 10-15% Fees

**October 18, 2024** - VirdisPay, a non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor, today announced that cannabis dispensaries can save up to 75% on payment processing fees compared to traditional high-risk processors. While traditional processors charge 10-15% for cannabis businesses, VirdisPay offers just 2.5% transaction fees with zero banking restrictions.

## The Cannabis Payment Processing Crisis

Cannabis dispensaries face a unique financial burden: traditional payment processors either reject them entirely or charge exorbitant fees of 10-15% per transaction. This creates an unsustainable cost structure for legal businesses operating in a $30 billion industry.

"Most cannabis dispensaries are paying 10-15% in processing fees, which is 3-6 times higher than standard credit card processing," said the VirdisPay team. "A $100 purchase costs the business $10-15 just in payment processing. That's unsustainable for any business model."

## 75% Fee Reduction with Cryptocurrency Payments

VirdisPay's non-custodial cryptocurrency payment solution offers cannabis dispensaries dramatic cost savings:

**Traditional High-Risk Processors:**
- Cannabis dispensaries: 10-15% transaction fees
- Account freezes and terminations common
- Long approval processes (6-12 months)
- High monthly minimums ($500-2000)

**VirdisPay Crypto Payments:**
- Cannabis dispensaries: 2.5% transaction fees (free tier)
- No banking restrictions or account freezes
- Instant approval and setup
- No monthly minimums

## Real-World Savings for Cannabis Dispensaries

**Small Dispensary ($50,000 monthly sales):**
- Traditional processor: $5,000-7,500 in fees (10-15%)
- VirdisPay: $1,250 in fees (2.5%)
- **Monthly savings: $3,750-6,250**
- **Annual savings: $45,000-75,000**

**Medium Dispensary ($200,000 monthly sales):**
- Traditional processor: $20,000-30,000 in fees
- VirdisPay: $5,000 in fees
- **Monthly savings: $15,000-25,000**
- **Annual savings: $180,000-300,000**

## Why Traditional Processors Charge So Much

High-risk processors justify their 10-15% fees by citing regulatory compliance costs, chargeback risk, limited banking relationships, and regulatory uncertainty. VirdisPay eliminates these costs through:

- **Non-custodial architecture** (no fund custody)
- **Smart contract escrow** (eliminates chargebacks)
- **Cryptocurrency payments** (no banking restrictions)
- **Built-in compliance** (automated AML/KYC)

## Four-Tier Pricing for Cannabis Businesses

VirdisPay offers transparent, tiered pricing:

**Free Tier:**
- 2.5% transaction fee
- Up to $10,000 monthly volume

**Starter ($29/month):**

## Industry-Wide Impact

The cannabis industry processes approximately $30 billion annually in the US alone. At current 10-15% processing fees, dispensaries are paying $3-4.5 billion annually in excessive payment processing costs.

"VirdisPay could save the cannabis industry billions in processing fees," the team stated. "That's money that can be reinvested in product quality, customer service, and business growth."
