Vape Shops Save 75% on Payment Processing with VirdisPay's 2.5% vs Traditional 10-15% Fees

October 18, 2024 - VirdisPay, a non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor, today announced that vape shops can save up to 75% on payment processing fees compared to traditional high-risk processors. While traditional processors charge 10-15% for vaping businesses, VirdisPay offers just 2.5% transaction fees with zero banking restrictions.

THE VAPING PAYMENT PROCESSING CRISIS

Vape shops face a unique financial burden: traditional payment processors either reject them entirely or charge exorbitant fees of 10-15% per transaction. This creates an unsustainable cost structure for legal businesses operating in a $20 billion industry.

"Most vape shops are paying 10-15% in processing fees, which is 3-6 times higher than standard credit card processing," said the VirdisPay team. "A $100 purchase costs the business $10-15 just in payment processing. That's unsustainable for any business model."

75% FEE REDUCTION WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY PAYMENTS

VirdisPay's non-custodial cryptocurrency payment solution offers vape shops dramatic cost savings:

Traditional High-Risk Processors:
- Vape shops: 10-15% transaction fees
- Account freezes and terminations common
- Long approval processes (6-12 months)
- High monthly minimums ($500-2000)

VirdisPay Crypto Payments:
- Vape shops: 2.5% transaction fees (free tier)
- No banking restrictions or account freezes
- Instant approval and setup
- No monthly minimums

REAL-WORLD SAVINGS FOR VAPE SHOPS

Small Vape Shop ($30,000 monthly sales):
- Traditional processor: $3,000-4,500 in fees (10-15%)
- VirdisPay: $750 in fees (2.5%)
- Monthly savings: $2,250-3,750
- Annual savings: $27,000-45,000

Medium Vape Shop ($100,000 monthly sales):

- VirdisPay: $2,500 in fees
- Monthly savings: $7,500-12,500
- Annual savings: $90,000-150,000

WHY TRADITIONAL PROCESSORS CHARGE SO MUCH

High-risk processors justify their 10-15% fees by citing regulatory compliance costs, chargeback risk, limited banking relationships, and regulatory uncertainty. VirdisPay eliminates these costs through:

- Non-custodial architecture (no fund custody)
- Smart contract escrow (eliminates chargebacks)
- Cryptocurrency payments (no banking restrictions)
- Built-in compliance (automated AML/KYC)

INDUSTRY-WIDE IMPACT

The vaping industry processes approximately $20 billion annually in the US alone. At current 10-15% processing fees, vape shops are paying $2-3 billion annually in excessive payment processing costs.
