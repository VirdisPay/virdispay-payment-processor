How VirdisPay is Revolutionizing Payment Processing for Vape Shops with 75% Fee Reduction

The vaping industry has long struggled with payment processing challenges. Traditional payment processors either reject vape shops entirely or charge exorbitant fees of 10-15% per transaction. This creates an unsustainable cost structure for legal businesses operating in a $20 billion industry.

VirdisPay, a non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor, is changing this narrative by offering vape shops a dramatic 75% reduction in payment processing fees. While traditional processors charge 10-15% for vaping businesses, VirdisPay offers just 2.5% transaction fees with zero banking restrictions.

The Vaping Payment Processing Crisis

Most vape shops are paying 10-15% in processing fees, which is 3-6 times higher than standard credit card processing. A $100 purchase costs the business $10-15 just in payment processing. That's unsustainable for any business model.

Traditional high-risk processors justify their exorbitant fees by citing regulatory compliance costs, chargeback risk, limited banking relationships, and regulatory uncertainty. However, VirdisPay eliminates these costs through:

• Non-custodial architecture (no fund custody)
• Smart contract escrow (eliminates chargebacks)
• Cryptocurrency payments (no banking restrictions)
• Built-in compliance (automated AML/KYC)

Real-World Impact for Vape Shops

The savings are substantial. Consider these examples:

Small Vape Shop ($30,000 monthly sales):
• Traditional processor: $3,000-4,500 in fees (10-15%)
• VirdisPay: $750 in fees (2.5%)
• Monthly savings: $2,250-3,750
• Annual savings: $27,000-45,000

Medium Vape Shop ($100,000 monthly sales):
• Traditional processor: $10,000-15,000 in fees
• VirdisPay: $2,500 in fees
• Monthly savings: $7,500-12,500
