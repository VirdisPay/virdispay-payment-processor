# Supplement Businesses Save 75% on Payment Processing with VirdisPay's 2.5% vs Traditional 10-15% Fees

**London, UK - October 18, 2024** - VirdisPay, a non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor, today announced that supplement businesses can save up to 75% on payment processing fees compared to traditional high-risk processors. While traditional processors charge 10-15% for nutraceutical businesses, VirdisPay offers just 2.5% transaction fees with zero banking restrictions.

## The Nutraceuticals Payment Processing Crisis

Supplement businesses face a unique financial burden: traditional payment processors either reject them entirely or charge exorbitant fees of 10-15% per transaction. This creates an unsustainable cost structure for legal businesses operating in a $50 billion industry.

"Most supplement businesses are paying 10-15% in processing fees, which is 3-6 times higher than standard credit card processing," said the VirdisPay team. "A $100 purchase costs the business $10-15 just in payment processing. That's unsustainable for any business model."

## 75% Fee Reduction with Cryptocurrency Payments

VirdisPay's non-custodial cryptocurrency payment solution offers supplement businesses dramatic cost savings:

**Traditional High-Risk Processors:**
- Supplement businesses: 10-15% transaction fees
- Account freezes and terminations common
- Long approval processes (6-12 months)
- High monthly minimums ($500-2000)

**VirdisPay Crypto Payments:**
- Supplement businesses: 2.5% transaction fees (free tier)
- No banking restrictions or account freezes
- Instant approval and setup
- No monthly minimums

## Real-World Savings for Supplement Businesses

**Small Supplement Business ($40,000 monthly sales):**
- Traditional processor: $4,000-6,000 in fees (10-15%)
- VirdisPay: $1,000 in fees (2.5%)
- **Monthly savings: $3,000-5,000**
- **Annual savings: $36,000-60,000**

**Medium Supplement Business ($150,000 monthly sales):**
- Traditional processor: $15,000-22,500 in fees
- VirdisPay: $3,750 in fees
- **Monthly savings: $11,250-18,750**
- **Annual savings: $135,000-225,000**

## Why Traditional Processors Charge So Much

High-risk processors justify their 10-15% fees by citing regulatory compliance costs, chargeback risk, limited banking relationships, and regulatory uncertainty. VirdisPay eliminates these costs through:

- **Non-custodial architecture** (no fund custody)
- **Smart contract escrow** (eliminates chargebacks)
- **Cryptocurrency payments** (no banking restrictions)
- **Built-in compliance** (automated AML/KYC)

## Four-Tier Pricing for Supplement Businesses

## Industry-Wide Impact

The nutraceuticals industry processes approximately $50 billion annually in the US alone. At current 10-15% processing fees, supplement businesses are paying $5-7.5 billion annually in excessive payment processing costs.
