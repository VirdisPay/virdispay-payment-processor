# Deployment Options (GitHub Account Flagged)

Since your GitHub account can't authorize third-party apps, here are your options:

## Option 1: Railway CLI (Recommended) ⭐

Deploy directly via command line - **NO GitHub OAuth needed!**

### Setup:
1. **Install Railway CLI:**
   ```powershell
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway:**
   ```powershell
   railway login
   ```
   This will open a browser - you can login with email/password (not GitHub!)

3. **Create New Project:**
   ```powershell
   railway init
   ```
   Follow prompts to create a project.

4. **Link Your Code:**
   ```powershell
   railway link
   ```

5. **Deploy:**
   ```powershell
   railway up
   ```

### Advantages:
- ✅ No GitHub OAuth required
- ✅ Deploys directly from your local code
- ✅ Full control over deployment

## Option 2: Use Railway Git Remote (GitHub not needed)

Railway provides its own Git remote - you can push directly to Railway!

1. **Install Railway CLI:**
   ```powershell
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login:**
   ```powershell
   railway login
   ```

3. **Create Project:**
   ```powershell
   railway init
   ```

4. **Get Railway Git Remote:**
   - In Railway dashboard → Your Project → Settings
   - Copy the Git URL (looks like: `https://railway.app/git/xxxxx`)

5. **Add Railway as Remote:**
   ```powershell
   git remote add railway https://railway.app/git/xxxxx
   ```

6. **Push to Railway:**
   ```powershell
   git push railway master
   ```

**Railway will auto-deploy on push!**

## Option 3: Create Temporary GitHub Account

If you really want GitHub integration:

1. Create a **new GitHub account** (personal email)
2. Transfer repo or create a new one
3. Use that account for Railway deployment
4. Keep your main account for development

**Note:** This is a workaround, but works if needed.

- Supports GitLab, Bitbucket, or direct Git push
- Free tier available

### Vercel
- Great for frontend

- Free tier

### DigitalOcean App Platform

## ⭐ **RECOMMENDED: Option 1 (Railway CLI)**
