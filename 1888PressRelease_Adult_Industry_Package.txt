Adult Content Platforms Save 75% on Payment Processing with VirdisPay's 2.5% vs Traditional 10-15% Fees

October 18, 2024 - VirdisPay, a non-custodial cryptocurrency payment processor, today announced that adult content platforms can save up to 75% on payment processing fees compared to traditional high-risk processors. While traditional processors charge 10-15% for adult businesses, VirdisPay offers just 2.5% transaction fees with zero banking restrictions.

THE ADULT INDUSTRY PAYMENT PROCESSING CRISIS

Adult content platforms face a unique financial burden: traditional payment processors either reject them entirely or charge exorbitant fees of 10-15% per transaction. This creates an unsustainable cost structure for legal businesses operating in a $100+ billion industry.

"Most adult content platforms are paying 10-15% in processing fees, which is 3-6 times higher than standard credit card processing," said the VirdisPay team. "A $100 purchase costs the business $10-15 just in payment processing. That's unsustainable for any business model."

75% FEE REDUCTION WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY PAYMENTS

VirdisPay's non-custodial cryptocurrency payment solution offers adult content platforms dramatic cost savings:

Traditional High-Risk Processors:
- Adult content platforms: 10-15% transaction fees
- Account freezes and terminations common
- Long approval processes (6-12 months)
- High monthly minimums ($500-2000)

VirdisPay Crypto Payments:
- Adult content platforms: 2.5% transaction fees (free tier)
- No banking restrictions or account freezes
- Instant approval and setup
- No monthly minimums

- Traditional processor: $5,000-7,500 in fees (10-15%)
- VirdisPay: $1,250 in fees (2.5%)

- VirdisPay: $5,000 in fees

- Annual savings: $180,000-300,000

WHY TRADITIONAL PROCESSORS CHARGE SO MUCH

High-risk processors justify their 10-15% fees by citing regulatory compliance costs, chargeback risk, limited banking relationships, and regulatory uncertainty. VirdisPay eliminates these costs through:

- Non-custodial architecture (no fund custody)
- Smart contract escrow (eliminates chargebacks)
- Cryptocurrency payments (no banking restrictions)
- Built-in compliance (automated AML/KYC)
