```
Account Flagged - Cannot Authorize Third-Party Applications for Business Deployment
```

**Message (Copy/Paste This):**
```
Hello GitHub Support,

My GitHub account has been flagged, which prevents me from authorizing third-party applications for deploying my business project.

Account: [YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]
Email: [YOUR_EMAIL]

Issue:
- I receive the error: "This account is flagged, and therefore cannot authorize a third party application"
- This occurs when trying to connect my repository to deployment platforms (Railway, Render, etc.)
- The flag does NOT affect normal GitHub usage (I can still push code, create repos, etc.)
- It ONLY blocks third-party OAuth authorization

Context:
- I'm trying to deploy a legitimate business project (VirdisPay - crypto payment processor)
- The project is: https://github.com/VirdisPay/virdispay-payment-processor
- This is blocking my ability to deploy to production environments
- I have completed 2FA setup as required

Request:
Could you please review my account and remove the OAuth/third-party authorization restriction? I believe this may be a false positive, as I'm using GitHub for legitimate business purposes.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

## Step 3: Submit and Wait
- GitHub usually responds within 24-48 hours
- Check your email for their response
- They may ask for additional verification

## What to Expect:
- They'll review your account
- If it's a false positive (which it likely is), they'll unflag it
- You'll be able to authorize third-party apps again

---

**Once unflagged, you'll be able to:**
✅ Use Railway, Render, and other deployment platforms
✅ Authorize third-party applications
✅ Deploy your project normally
