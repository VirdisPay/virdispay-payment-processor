Account Flagged - Cannot Authorize Third-Party Applications
```

**Message Template:**
```
Hello GitHub Support,

My GitHub account has been flagged and I'm unable to authorize third-party applications (Railway, Render, etc.) for deployment of my business project.

My account: [YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME]
Email: [YOUR_EMAIL]

Details:
- My account has been flagged for an extended period
- I cannot authorize third-party applications (getting error: "This account is flagged, and therefore cannot authorize a third party application")
- I'm trying to deploy a legitimate business project (VirdisPay payment processor)
- This is blocking my workflow and business operations

I believe this may be a false positive or misunderstanding. Could you please review my account and remove the flag so I can proceed with my deployment?

Thank you for your help.

[Your Name]
```

3. Add **2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)** if you haven't
4. Complete your profile (bio, location, etc.)

## Step 4: Review Recent Activity

Check if anything looks suspicious:

- If you see something odd, mention it in your support ticket

---

## Step 5: Be Patient But Follow Up

- **GitHub Support Response Time:** Usually 24-48 hours
- If no response after 48 hours, send a polite follow-up
- Be professional and explain it's blocking business operations

## What NOT to Do:

‚ùå Don't create a new GitHub account (could make things worse)
‚ùå Don't spam support with multiple tickets
‚ùå Don't try to bypass restrictions

## Alternative While Waiting:

If you need to deploy immediately while waiting for GitHub support:

1. **Ask a colleague/friend** to connect their GitHub account to Railway/Render (temporarily)
2. **Or wait 24-48 hours** for GitHub support to respond

---

## Expected Outcome:

Once unflagged, you'll be able to:
- ‚úÖ Authorize third-party applications
- ‚úÖ Use Railway, Render, etc.
- ‚úÖ Deploy normally

**Most flags are resolved within 1-2 business days!** üìÖ
