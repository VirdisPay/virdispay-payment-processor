VirdisPay is a cryptocurrency payment processor for high-risk industries systematically rejected by traditional banks. We serve legal cannabis dispensaries, vape shops, nutraceuticals, adult content, gambling platforms, forex brokers, and crypto services in the UK and US.

THE PROBLEM

Legitimate businesses in high-risk sectors face severe payment processing challenges: cannabis dispensaries denied merchant accounts, vape shops charged excessive fees and facing sudden account freezes, supplement companies blocked due to FDA concerns, and adult content creators banned from PayPal and Stripe. Even in jurisdictions where these businesses operate legally, traditional financial institutions refuse service due to regulatory concerns, reputational risk, and industry bias.

The cost is staggering. High-risk merchants typically pay 10-15% in transaction fees for adult content and CBD businesses, 8-12% for vaping, and 6-10% for cannabis dispensaries. Add rolling reserves that lock up 10-30% of capital for 6-12 months, 3-7 day settlement delays, $25-$100 chargeback fees, and the constant risk of sudden account termination. For cannabis businesses alone, the lack of banking access costs the industry over $1 billion annually in excessive fees and operational inefficiencies.

OUR SOLUTION

VirdisPay enables businesses to accept stablecoin payments (USDC, USDT, DAI) that maintain a stable $1.00 value - eliminating cryptocurrency volatility risk while gaining all the benefits of blockchain technology. Our Smart Payment Routing technology automatically analyzes network conditions in real-time and selects the cheapest blockchain for each transaction, reducing gas fees from $20-$200 (Ethereum) to just $0.01 (Polygon), saving businesses 99.98% on transaction costs.

Unlike traditional payment processors, VirdisPay operates as a non-custodial platform. Payments flow directly from customer wallets to merchant wallets through secure smart contracts. We never hold funds, store private keys, or take custody of payments - eliminating custody risk and reducing regulatory complexity.

KEY FEATURES

Smart Payment Routing: Our proprietary system analyzes blockchain networks in real-time and routes each payment through the most cost-effective network. This reduces gas fees from $20-$200 (Ethereum) to just $0.01 (Polygon), saving businesses 99.98% on transaction costs. Merchants save thousands monthly on gas fees alone.

Stablecoin Payments: Accept USDC, USDT, and DAI - cryptocurrencies backed 1:1 by US dollars that maintain a constant $1.00 value. When customers pay $100 in USDC, merchants receive exactly $100 in value. No volatility, no exchange rate risk, all the benefits of cryptocurrency.

Zero Chargebacks: Cryptocurrency transactions are final and irreversible. Eliminate chargeback fraud entirely, save $25-$100 per chargeback fee, and remove the risk of account termination due to high chargeback ratios. For high-risk businesses, this alone can save thousands monthly.

Instant Settlement: Payments confirmed in 2-3 seconds and funds arrive directly in merchant wallets immediately. No 3-5 day holds, no rolling reserves locking up 10-30% of revenue for months, no frozen accounts, no payment processor approvals needed.

Global Payments: Accept payments from customers worldwide without currency conversion fees, international transaction fees, or geographic restrictions. One merchant account works globally with the same low 1% fee everywhere.

Multi-Chain Infrastructure: Support for Ethereum, Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and Optimism gives merchants and customers flexibility while our Smart Routing ensures the lowest possible fees on every transaction.

Built-in Compliance: Comprehensive KYC/AML system including identity verification, document upload and review, sanctions list screening, PEP (Politically Exposed Persons) checks, transaction monitoring, risk assessment, and automated compliance reporting. Helps merchants meet UK FCA and US FinCEN requirements without expensive third-party services.
