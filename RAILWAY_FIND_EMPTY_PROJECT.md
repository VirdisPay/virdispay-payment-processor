# Finding "Empty Project" in Railway

If you only see "Deploy Project" (GitHub option), look for:

## Method 1: Look for "Empty Project" Option
1. Click **"Deploy Project"** (or the main button)
2. Look for tabs or options:
   - **"Empty Project"** or **"Blank Project"**
   - **"From Scratch"**
   - **"Start from Scratch"**
3. Click that option

## Method 2: Check Left Sidebar
- Look for **"+"** or **"New"** button in the left sidebar
- Click it â†’ Should show "Empty Project" option

## Method 3: If Still Not Working
Railway might have changed their UI. Let's use **Render.com** instead - it's easier and more reliable!
